## Patreon.Net
A .NET implementation of the Patreon V2 API, targeting **.NET 5** and **.NET 6**.

## Usage
1. Create an application on the [Patreon developer portal](https://www.patreon.com/portal/registration/register-clients) and grab your access token, refresh token and client ID.
2. Create a `PatreonClient` with your tokens and client ID:
```csharp
var client = new PatreonClient("access token", "refresh token", "client id");

var campaigns = await client.GetCampaignsAsync(Includes.All);
foreach(var campaign in campaigns.Data)
    Console.WriteLine($"{campaign.Id} has {campaign.Attributes.PatronCount} patrons");

client.Dispose();
```

## Notes
This implementation isn't fully complete yet but is in a working state (see implemented endpoints below).

### Token refreshing
Patreon.Net automatically handles token refreshing and exposes an event containing the newly generated access and refresh tokens to store for later, in case you need to restart your application:
```csharp
client.TokensRefreshedAsync += OnTokensRefreshedAsync;

private async Task OnTokensRefreshedAsync(OAuthToken token)
{
    await SaveNewTokensForLater(token);
}
```
In case of tokens expiring while your application is offline, you'll have to manually grab them from the website again.

### Paged resources
Certain endpoints return arrays of resources which can be paged if there are too many resources to fit in a single request, such as `PatreonClient.GetCampaignMembersAsync()`. You can get the next pages by passing in the page cursor from the previous call to the corrosponding overload:
```csharp
var members = await GetCampaignMembersAsync(campaignId, Includes.All);
if(members != null)
{
    do
    {
        //your work here
        
        string nextPageCursor = members.Meta.Pagination.Cursor?.Next;
        if (nextPageCursor != null)
            members = await patreonClient.GetCampaignMembersAsync(campaignId, nextPageCursor, Includes.All);
        else
            members = null;
    }
    while(members != null);
}
```
This implementation is a little cumbersome and will be improved soonâ„¢.
